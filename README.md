# CaptionKraft

## Introduction
Caption Kraft is an innovative project that brings together the power of computer vision, natural language processing, and MLOps practices to create a state-of-the-art image captioning model. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for text generation, Caption Kraft generates contextually rich and accurate image captions.

## Motivation
The project is driven by the need to democratize AI development, particularly in the domain of image captioning. With the increasing restriction of access to proprietary datasets and costly pre-trained models, Caption Kraft provides a cost-effective alternative that empowers developers to create custom datasets and deploy AI models efficiently using integrated MLOps tools.
